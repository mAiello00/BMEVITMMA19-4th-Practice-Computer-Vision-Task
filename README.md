# BMEVITMMA19-4th-Practice-Computer-Vision-Task
Fourth practice session for BMEVITMMA19. Computer Vision with a neural network.

# Three parts to this task:

1. Add some other type of image augmentation to the training pipeline. Check out the list of available transforms here: https://pytorch.org/vision/main/transforms.html. Visualize the training images, save the generated figure.
2. Add batch normalization layers (2D) to our custom CNN, after each ReLU. Keep the network width at 64. What is the exact number of parameters in the original network? print it out! What is the exact number of trainable parameters in the new network? print it out!
3. Add a confusion matrix to your metrics (https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/classification/confusion_matrix.html). Run an evaluation, and visualize the confusion matrix.

# Jupytr Notebook
All work was done in the 01_Computer_Vision.ipynb notebook. The work for the task begins after the 'Homework' heading. The results for each task are numbered from 1- 3.
